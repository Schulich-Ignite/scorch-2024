### Custom Fonts with CSS

Using CSS rules, you can add custom fonts or import fonts from a number of providers to add a more custom feel to your webpage.

Information on how to do so can be found in [this](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face-in-css/) CSS Tricks article.

### How do I know if I have enough contrast

A long time ago the w3c created [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (Web content accessibility Guidelines), a massive specification for this… ironically it wasn’t very accessible, and no one wanted to read it

So people built tools to validate this for you:

-   [Like this](https://color.a11y.com/?wc3)
-   [or this one](https://contrastchecker.com/)

### Additional CSS Resources

A lot of CSS and styling is learned from other people. There are too many css style rules and tricks for one person to learn. It’s a good idea to find videos and guides for specific things and then understand the code they use and learn to implement it in your own projects.
